# Overview

As part of the Udacity Front-End Developers Nanodegree, a testing project has to be finished. An RSS feeds web-based app is given for which testing has to be performed to ensure that the web app performs as expected. [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) is used for testing the Javascript code.
