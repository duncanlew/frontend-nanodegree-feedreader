# Overview

As part of the Udacity Front-End Developers Nanodegree, a testing project has to be finished. An RSS feeds web-based app is given for which testing has to be performed to ensure that the web app performs as expected. [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) is used for testing the Javascript code. Functionalities of the web app that are tested include the (re)loading and definition of the feeds via ajax requests and default display position of the menu.
